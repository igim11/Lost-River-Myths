          <h2>The Importance of Myth</h2>
          <p>Myths are more than stories from a time
            forgotten; they are a reflection of how
            the people we came from once
            understood the world. It shows how they
            were shaped and influenced by the
            unique aspects of the land they lived on
            and the beliefs that developed here.</p>
          <p>These stories were passed down
            through generations despite all odds,
            not just to entertain, but to teach,
            remember, and connect with where
            they came from. When we return to
            these myths, we reconnect with older
            ways of seeing, and with a part of
            ourselves that history and time may
            have silenced.</p>

          <h2>In Hopes of Sharing</h2>
          <p>This project began with the simple goal of
            making these tales more approachable and
            easier to find out about. The Lost River Myths
            was created as a way to introduce young
            readers to Kapampangan Mythology
            through a visually engaging and easy-to-
            understand picture book.</p>
          <p>The website continues that effort by offering
            ways to revisit the stories, explore other
            names from Kapampangan myths, and
            support those who want to create works
            inspired by these stories. A small space
            where myth can be seen, shared, and
            remembered.</p>

      <h2>What can you find here?</h2>
      <p>This website hosts a downloadable copy of The Lost
        River Myths book, audio versions of each story, and an
        art gallery featuring submitted works inspired by
        Kapampangan mythos. These materials are here to
        make the stories more accessible beyond the page and
        to encourage others to take part in keeping them alive.</p>
